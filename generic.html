								<p>As a highly motivated and skilled individual, I have achieved a great deal in both my academic and professional pursuits. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a Master's degree in Computer Science, both from the University of Thessaly. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Game and Media Technology at the University of Utrecht.</p>
								<p>During my time at the University of Thessaly, I participated in the Formula Student competition in Germany as a member of the Centaurous Racing Team. This experience taught me the importance of teamwork, effective communication, and problem-solving skills. Additionally, I completed a research paper on Educational Simulator for algorithms and data structures, which helped me to develop strong analytical and research skills.</p>
								<p>I have also gained practical experience through my work as an intern and contractor for the Creative Technologies Learning Lab (CTLL). During my time with CTLL, I developed a game in Unity and a STEM game for schools. I am proud to have contributed to the development of educational games that can inspire and teach the next generation of students. Recently, I also worked as a contractor for Utrecht University, where I developed a VR serious game for students in Unity.</p>
								<p>Apart from my academic and professional achievements, I have also helped a client establish an online store selling cosmetics worldwide, which is located in Greece. This experience has allowed me to develop my entrepreneurial skills further, including managing the website, creating marketing strategies, and providing customer service. It has been a rewarding experience to see the business thrive under my guidance.</p>
								<p>In terms of software skills, I am proficient in Microsoft Office, programming languages such as C, C#, HTML 5, CSS, SQL, JAVA, C++, and Python, as well as game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine. I am also fluent in Greek, my native language, and English, where I have achieved a proficiency level of C2, as demonstrated by my IELTS score of 6.5.</p>
								<p>In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I have also participated in several seminars and courses, including the Leadership and Soft Skills seminar organized by the University of Thessaly, the Machine Learning course on Coursera, and the Introduction to Game Development course on Udemy. I am also the recipient of the Silver Award in the EIT Health Innovation Days Pitching competition in November 2019.</p>
								<p>Overall, I believe that my diverse skill set and experience make me a well-rounded candidate for any position in the field of game and media technology, as well as in other related fields. I am highly motivated, innovative, and committed to delivering quality work that meets and exceeds expectations.</p>
